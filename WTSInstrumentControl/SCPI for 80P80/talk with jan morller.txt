[?1/?26/?2016 3:38 PM] Mingming Yang: 
hello
this is Mingming
[?1/?26/?2016 3:39 PM] Jan Moeller: 
hey Mengming
sorry Mingming
[?1/?26/?2016 3:42 PM] Mingming Yang: 
if we want to test 80+80, that means we have to test each pair of antena. At the same time two VST can not map to one band of merlot. my question is how can we test 80+80 with wts?
that is the mapping isssue we faced
[?1/?26/?2016 3:43 PM] Jan Moeller: 
two VSTs cannot map to the same ports
but the signal can be split to separate ports
[?1/?26/?2016 3:44 PM] Mingming Yang: 
yes , right
[?1/?26/?2016 3:44 PM] Jan Moeller: 
the pinot cannot physically have 2 VSTs on the same port at the same time
it can have 1 generator and 1 analyzer
[?1/?26/?2016 3:45 PM] Mingming Yang: 
I mean same band ,different port
bank
sorry 
[?1/?26/?2016 3:46 PM] Jan Moeller: 
they cannot be on the same bank (quadrant) so port 0-3 is one VST and 4-7 another
the SG is actually transmitting on all 4 ports of the bank at the same time
[?1/?26/?2016 3:47 PM] Mingming Yang: 
yes , you are right, so the question comes. how can we connect 4 antennas to port if test 80+80?
[?1/?26/?2016 3:47 PM] Jan Moeller: 
do you need to measure on all 4 ports at the same time
[?1/?26/?2016 3:48 PM] Mingming Yang: 
not all 4 ports, we have to test  2 ports at the same time 
[?1/?26/?2016 3:49 PM] Jan Moeller: 
and you need to split the signal so you measure 80+80 on 2 antennas at the same time
meaning you need 4 simultanius measurements (and 4 VSTs)?
[?1/?26/?2016 3:50 PM] Mingming Yang: 
but we have 2 vsts at most in wts
[?1/?26/?2016 3:51 PM] Jan Moeller: 
so if you need 4 VSTs then you cannot use the WTS HW you need to use a VST system and the WTS-IS SW stack
we can run on VST only systems also
we support up to 16x16 but have until now only tested 4x4
[?1/?26/?2016 3:53 PM] Jan Moeller: 
if you only need to use 2 VSTs then you can use WTS you just have to split the signal so one part is on PORT0 the other on PORT3 next uses Port1&5 then Port 2&6 and last 3&7
thats how we handle 2x2 MIMO
[?1/?26/?2016 3:56 PM] Mingming Yang: 
if we connect att0 to port 0, att1 to port1; att2 to port 4, att3 to port5; we can att0&2 and att1&3, but  we can not test att0&1 and att2&3 since we can not change hardware connections during test. right?
[?1/?26/?2016 3:59 PM] Jan Moeller: 
we cannot measure simultanuously  on 2 ports on bank A (port 0-3) or on 2 ports on bank B (4-7) we can measure simultanuously on any combination of bank A and B
[?1/?26/?2016 4:00 PM] Mingming Yang: 
this dut need to be test arbitrary two antennas 
[?1/?26/?2016 4:00 PM] Jan Moeller: 
if you need todo that then you should use a VST only system and switches. which we also support in WTS-IS
then you have the ports on the VSTs and then separate commands for the switches
then you can in principle route anything to anything
[?1/?26/?2016 4:01 PM] Jan Moeller: 
but the Pinot/Merlot switch cannot physically have 2 analysers on the same bank at the same time
it is also so that the generator transmits out of all 4 ports in a bank at the same time
[?1/?26/?2016 4:02 PM] Jan Moeller: 
we can attenuate the signal per port but we physically cannot turn it off
[?1/?26/?2016 4:06 PM] Mingming Yang: 
so you mean we can not test 80+80 using wts/wtm for this case, right?
[?1/?26/?2016 4:07 PM] Jan Moeller: 
if you need to measure any combination on 4 antennas at the same time then its not possible to physically connect it to a WTS HW system
then you need to use pure VSTs and switcing
or you need to split it even more and use a 16 port WTS
having evey antenna connected to 4 ports
[?1/?26/?2016 4:09 PM] Jan Moeller: 
so antenna 1 is on Port 0,4,8,12 and antenna 2 on 1,5,9,13 etc
then you can measure all combinations 
but there is still only 2 VSTs 
[?1/?26/?2016 4:09 PM] Mingming Yang: 
do we have 16 prots wts with 4 vsts?
[?1/?26/?2016 4:09 PM] Jan Moeller: 
nope
[?1/?26/?2016 4:10 PM] Mingming Yang: 
ok , i see
[?1/?26/?2016 4:10 PM] Jan Moeller: 
do you need 4 VSTs?
[?1/?26/?2016 4:11 PM] Mingming Yang: 
 we need to demo 4-up wlan test system with 80+80 test capaility based on wts/wtm
if this case , yes
[?1/?26/?2016 4:11 PM] Jan Moeller: 
but understand that a vst only system is also WTS
we created 4x4 mimo on a vst only system
and my test system is also only a chassis and 2 VSTs
and we do also support switches
[?1/?26/?2016 4:13 PM] Jan Moeller: 
so the SW stack will still work
and WTM can also work with that (though we dont have component for controlling the switch yet)
[?1/?26/?2016 4:15 PM] Mingming Yang: 
so what is the best solution for this case from your view
[?1/?26/?2016 4:16 PM] Jan Moeller: 
i must say its not completely clear for me what you try todo
it does not really sound like production test
[?1/?26/?2016 4:17 PM] Mingming Yang: 
we have to show our test capability before move to production line
the customer is a ODM
[?1/?26/?2016 4:18 PM] Jan Moeller: 
yeah but then the instrument you demo is very differnet from the one you need in production 
if its a demo then i would use a WTS system to show you can measure 80+80 and MIMO and then tell them that we can scale to whatever they will end up with liking
[?1/?26/?2016 4:19 PM] Jan Moeller: 
if they end up having to measure 80+80 in 4x4 mimo simultanuasly then we can do that. we will just need 16 VSTs todo it
and when they see the price they will probably figure out that thats probably not what they want
[?1/?26/?2016 4:22 PM] Jan Moeller: 
if you need to measure it on 2 antennas simultanously you will need 4 VSTs 
so if you want to demo that then take a chassis and 4 VSTs and then probably a switch or 2
[?1/?26/?2016 4:23 PM] Mingming Yang: 
another option is to use two VSTs and switch
[?1/?26/?2016 4:23 PM] Jan Moeller: 
also doable
but why not then a 16 port WTS
or show only on the 3 antennas
i am pretty sure that the company you demo too understand that switching an RF signal is something that can be done
[?1/?26/?2016 4:24 PM] Jan Moeller: 
so you should only need to demo 80+80 and MIMO
the rest is geography
[?1/?26/?2016 4:26 PM] Mingming Yang: 
ok  , got it 
thanks a lot
[?1/?26/?2016 4:26 PM] Jan Moeller: 
more than welcome
